/**
 * Every connector there is.
 *
 * This list is the whole of the public read API. It is also, and this is the
 * reason it looks the way it does, the source api.json is compiled from — so
 * the document a frontend hands to its code generator cannot describe a route
 * that does not exist, or miss one that does.
 *
 * Everything here reads the newest *published* revision. Not the draft: an
 * unpublished edit is exactly what should not be visible from outside, and the
 * one endpoint that serves the draft has always required the preview build's
 * token. So a connector answers what is on the public site, which is also what
 * makes it safe to answer it to anyone.
 *
 * To add one: append it below. The route registers itself in worker/index.ts,
 * the document grows an entry, the dev panel grows a card.
